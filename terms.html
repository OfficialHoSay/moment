                <h3>Purchases</h3>
                <p>We will not charge you to access the core functionality of the Service. However, you may purchase other products via the Service, as noted below. Unless stated otherwise, these purchases are one-time, instant payments.</p>
                <p>The jxse.dev Accounts Service provides a way for other Services to create payments (“Transactions” or “Purchases”) linked to your Account. All Purchases are deemed final and the provider is under no obligation to provide refunds, except where required by law or at our discretion. When purchasing a product, you agree to abide by the listed Refund Policy, if provided, which can vary between products. You agree that in the event of your Account being terminated, the Service will not provide a refund for any products and access to the products will cease.</p>
                <p>You are responsible for determining and paying the appropriate government taxes, fees, and service charges resulting from a transaction occurring through the Service. We are not responsible for collecting, reporting, paying, or remitting to you any such taxes, fees, or service charges, except as may otherwise be required by law.</p>
                <p>Purchases through jxse.dev Accounts are accompanied with information on how to access the product. If the product is digital, you should be able to access it immediately. If the product is a physical good, you will receive information about its fulfillment after completing the purchase.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Selling as a Merchant</h3>
                <p>Some Services may allow you to sell products to Account-holders, classifying you as a “Merchant.”</p>
                <p>Merchants are responsible for keeping their information (including, but not limited to, requisite legal documentation and payment details) up to date. If your information is out of date, you are responsible for any outcome incurred by the discrepancy.</p>
                <p>We try to provide Merchants with timely access to funds, but you may occassionally encounter delays or other issues accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payments for compliance reasons, such as incomplete personal information, or violations of the Terms. The availability of funds from Transactions is at our sole discretion. If you have questions about receiving your funds, please contact us.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, certain activities (included, but not limited to, chargebacks and refunds) encountered as a Merchant can cause your Account’s balance (“Balance”) to become negative. If your Balance becomes negative, we may recover those funds from future Transactions. We reserve the right to terminate your Account or revoke your eligiblity to sell as a Merchant at our sole discretion, and may do so in cases where we discover abuse or your Balance exceeds a minimum amount or stays negative for a prolonged period of time.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Links to Other Websites</h3>
                <p>Our Service and any software you access as a result of it may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by jxse.dev.</p>
                <p>jxse.dev has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that the company shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such websites or services.</p>
                <p>We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third-party websites or services that you visit.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Other Services</h3>
                <p>Through your jxse.dev Account, you may sign into other services. These services can be operated by us (earlier defined as “Services”), but may not always be (“third-party services”). Although you are using the Service to authenticate with these other services, you are bound by the terms of both services.</p>
                <p>When signing into third-party services, you will be given a summary of the data that you are granting them access to. You are responsible for all of the permissions granted to any other service.</p>
                <p>Termination of your account will result in a loss of access to these services. First-party Services will, within 24 hours, delete and revoke access to data stored accordingly to match the state of your Account on the service, when terminated either by yourself or us. Third-party services will not be notified in changes to account state, and so you should move, deactivate, or delete third-party services using your Account before deactivating or deleting it. Failure to do so will result in loss of access to the third-party service, and an inability to easily opt to delete/deactivate your account on the third-party service.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Termination</h3>
                <p>You may terminate your Account at any time and for any reason by visiting the jxse.dev Accounts Website, signing in with the aforementioned Account, clicking the User menu dropdown (indicated by a User icon and/or your full name) in the top right corner, and choosing “Deactivate.” This is only temporary, and persists until the next time you sign in. You may also permanently terminate your account by choosing “Delete” from that same screen. If your account is not logged in to within seven days from the request, it will be permanently and unrecoverably removed.</p>
                <p>We may terminate your Account and your access to the Service (or, at our sole option, applicable portions of the Service) at any time and for any reason. We are not required to provide you with any notice or warning prior to any such termination. You may, as the result of termination, lose your Account and all information and data associated therewith, including without limitation your purchases (goods), as applicable and we are under no obligation to compensate you for any such loss.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
                <p>Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Warranty</h3>

IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE A GOOD USER EXPERIENCE, WE CANNOT AND DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE SECURE OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS FUNCTION WITHOUT DELAYS, DISRUPTIONS, OR IMPERFECTIONS. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

                <h3>Limited Liability</h3>
                <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PERSON FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR OTHER INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST DATA, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE OR OTHER MATERIALS ON, ACCESSED THROUGH OR DOWNLOADED FROM THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES.</p>
                <p>THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO US IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS IN THE THREE (3) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM OR (B) $100. THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THESE TERMS DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHICH MEANS THAT SOME OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN THESE JURISDICTIONS, THE COMPANY’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
